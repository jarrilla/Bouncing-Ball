## N-Particle Ideal Gas Collision Sim

The eventual goal of this is to simulate a ball being dropped from rest inside a room filled with a homogeneous gas with some initial temperature.

I am interested in studying the retarding effects of the gas on the ball as a function of initial temperature and further comparing it to known formulas for air resistance.
